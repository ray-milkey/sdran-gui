# SdRanGui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 9.0.0-rc.7.

It is based on the same foundation at the `onos-gui` of the ÂµONOS project
([see](https://docs.onosproject.org/onos-gui/docs/config-gui/)).

This foundation was just copied over from ONOS GUI, and can be discarded when the 2 are merged together.

The main application happens inside the `web/sd-ran-gui/src/app/onos-sdran` folder.
It uses the new [Google Maps Angular Component]

It uses [grpc-web] on the [Envoy Proxy] to communicate to the `trafficsim` backend

Use [docker-compose] to run the `sd-ran-gui`, `envoy-proxy` and `trafficsim` together. See [README.md](../../README.md)

The original JavaScript only application is in the `web/sd-ran-gui/originalJs` directory

To see how to install NodeJS and Angular CLI on your system follow the
[Development Prerequisites](https://docs.onosproject.org/onos-gui/docs/prerequisites/)
of the ONOS GUI project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor]).
